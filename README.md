# Traffic Signal Controller Using 8086 Microprocessor üö¶  

This project implements a **microprocessor-based traffic signal controller** using the **8086 microprocessor**, programmed in **assembly language**, and simulated in **Proteus Design Suite**. It manages a four-way intersection, incorporating features such as two-phase control and priority-based traffic management.

## üìå Project Overview  

The **Traffic Signal Controller** is designed to:  
- Simulate real-world traffic light behavior.  
- Provide efficient traffic management using assembly-level programming.  
- Incorporate features like emergency vehicle priority.  

This project highlights the integration of software (assembly code) and hardware (microprocessor components) to build a functional traffic management system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Used  

### Hardware Simulated in Proteus:  
1. **8086 Microprocessor**: Executes the assembly program to control traffic signals.  
2. **8255A Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI)**: Controls the LEDs based on microprocessor commands.  
3. **LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)**: Represent the traffic signals.  
4. **74ALS138 Decoder**: Handles address decoding for smooth communication.  
5. **74LS373 Latches**: Stabilize signals from the 8255A for consistent LED output.  
6. **Resistors**: Protect LEDs from excessive current.  
7. **Connecting Wires**: Interconnect components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Features  

### Traffic Control Modes:  
1. **Two-Phase System**:  
   - Alternates green and red lights between north-south and east-west directions.  
   - Includes yellow light transitions for safety.  

2. **Priority-Based System**:  
   - Assigns priority to specific directions, such as emergency lanes.  
   - Implements individual direction green light phases.  

### Functionality:  
- Designed using **8086 assembly language** for precise timing and control.  
- Simulated in **Proteus** for hardware accuracy and validation.
